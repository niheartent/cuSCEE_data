# cuSCEE_data
Run logs for cuSCEE

/data for datasets 
/test_accuracy for test the accuarcy of system, compare the cuSCEE energy result with NNQS, the smaller the difference from the ground state energy, the better.
/test_optimization presents the logs of ablation experiments, including execution time and memory overhead.
/test_parallel displays the logs during distributed execution.
